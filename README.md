# Score-informed Wave-U-Net

This repository extends [Wave-U-Net](https://github.com/f90/Wave-U-Net) to support score-informed separation. It was created as part of my Master's thesis, in which I have used it for source separation of choral music. See the original Wave-U-Net repository for more information on the model architecture and installation instructions.

<!--
## Dataset

For our experiments on choral music, we created a dataset of synthesized Bach chorale harmonizations.

## Pretrained models

You can download some of our pretrained models that we have trained on the synthesized Bach chorale dataset.

## Perform separation

For a simple demonstration, you can run a pretrained model on an audio example consisting of two voices using the following command:

`` python Predict.py with cfg.full_44KHz ``

The model will separate the recording into the two tracks and the outputs will be saved to the `output` folder.

## Training

To train a model, create a JSON configuration file specifying model parameters and run the training script.
